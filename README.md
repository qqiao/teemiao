# Teemiao

Teemiao is a set of convenient tools for building other applications.

Currently it supports the following functionalities:

## `build-info`

Generates a JSON file representing some metadata of the current build.
Currently this metadata includes the build time and the current git revision
of the code base.

TODO: in longer run, we would like this to support VCS(s) other than just git,
but as of now, this isn't a priority.
